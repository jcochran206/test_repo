Hello my name is Sacha (2nd Driver). I merged my branch (nav-styles) back into master, then deleted my branch. I should have used the 'no fast forward' flag so it would have indicated the merge in the git log, e.g. git merge --no-f nav-styles. Next time. Btw, re: deleting remote branch see https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-delete-remote-branches-in-git#:~:text=
