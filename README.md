Hello my name is Jon (1st Driver)

Hello my name is Sacha (2nd Driver).

Sacha: I merged my branch (nav-styles) back into master, then deleted my branch. I should have used the 'no fast forward' flag so it would have indicated the merge in the git log, e.g. git merge --no-f nav-styles. Next time. Btw, re: deleting remote branch see https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-delete-remote-branches-in-git#:~:text=

Jon: accepted the merge between our test html page and committed to master deleted add js branch

Sacha: (Now acting as 1st Driver) Created another branch 'sacha-reprise' with some subsequent changes. Submitted Pull Request to Jon, asking if kosher to merge ;P
